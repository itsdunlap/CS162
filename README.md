Week 5 - pomodoro.py - notes about this assignment


  This was a pomodoro timer widget I recreated using my instructor Norah Wang's instructions. In building this project, we learned about building a GUI from the ground up using Tkinter and learned about many keywords as well as the "time" and "global" keywords, brief debugging instruction (setting breakpoints and such), as well as the importance of talking out-loud through the problem solving process. 
  Timer instructions: Click the "start" button to start a twenty-five minute timer. Click the "pause/reset" button to pause the timer. Click the "next" button to reset the timer to twenty minutes.
  Future goals with this project: I want to refine this widget to have the buttons each work for their intended purpose. It would also be nice to allow for the user to select a duration on the timer. And if can manage to implement the last two adaptations,.. I would like to add a to-do list feature that the user can use to keep something specific in mind that they would like to accomplish during each timer, and a recap feature to allow users to make note of what they achieved in the timer. It would also be a useful addition to add a recap notes history to show the user all that was accomplished on a specific day.
